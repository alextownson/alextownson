## Hello! My name is Alex (he/they).

I am a designer and developer based in Toronto. 

I began by designing ephemera for an independent bookshop that I worked at. This led me to pursue a graphic design degree at OCAD University which I completed in January 2023. While in school I honed in on two skills; motion design and front-end development. The latter is an area I am most passionate about and I have supplemented my degree with countless hours of programming.

### Currently working on:

I am working on a resource for cyclists called [Bike Parts](https://github.com/alextownson/bike-parts). This is a web and mobile application that teaches cyclists the names of bike parts as well as basic bike mechanics. I've created this project in hopes to lower the barrier to entry in bicycle mechanics as it has traditionally excluded marginalized folks. 

### Currently learning:

1. I am working through [Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Path](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path-b/) to help fill in/make salient any gaps in my knowledge.

2. I am also working through [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). 3D development is an area that I find incredibly exciting.
