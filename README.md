## Hello! My name is Alex (he/they).

I design and develop user interfaces. While studying graphic design at OCAD University, I became incredibly fascinated with the intersection of design and technology. This led me to focus my studies on UI/UX design and to supplement my degree by learning front-end development.

When I'm not working, I enjoy making music, riding bikes, and hanging out with my two cats.

### Currently working on:

I am working on a resource for cyclists called [Bike Parts](https://github.com/alextownson/bike-parts). This is a web and mobile application that teaches cyclists the names of bike parts as well as basic bike mechanics. I've created this project in hopes to lower the barrier to entry in bicycle mechanics as it has traditionally excluded marginalized folks. 

### Currently learning:

1. I am working through [Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) as an extension of the Front-End Engineer certification I completed.

2. I am also working through [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/). 3D development is an area that I find incredibly exciting.
